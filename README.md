This repository contains backups of worlds friends and I play on.

## What do I do?

1. Download the file you want to play on Terraria.
2. Place it in your `../Terraria/Worlds` folder.
3. Remove the `.bak` extension to make it recognizable by Terraria as valid world file.
4. Possibly rename the file if you wish to have a different world name.
5. Start client/server hosting the world.
6. ???
7. Profit!
